String C is said to be interleaving of string A and string B if it contains all the characters of A and B and the relative order of characters of both the strings is preserved in C.
For example, if values of A, B and C are given below.
A=xyz, B=abcd
C=xabyczd
Then, string C is the interleaving of strings A and B.
