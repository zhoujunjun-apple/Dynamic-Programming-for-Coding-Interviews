    Given a two-dimensional square matrix cost[][] of order M*N where cost[i][j] represents the cost of passing though cell(i, j).
Total cost to reach a particular cell is the sum of costs of all the cells in that path (including the starting and final cell).
We can only move either downward or rightward.
    Write a function that return the minimum cost of moving from the top-left cell to bottom-right cell of the matrix.
